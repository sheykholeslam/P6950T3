# Growing Degree Days: an Extended Assignment for CMSC6950

Live Link : https://github.com/jmunroe/CMSC6950/blob/master/gddproject.md

This project / extended assignment is intended to give you
experience working with a scientific computation workflow.

## Introduction

From wikipedia.org:
Growing degree days (GDD), also called growing degree units (GDUs), are a heuristic tool in phenology. GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists, gardeners, and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, or a crop will reach maturity.

A quick search on Google with the terms 'growing degree day' gives a several sites describing this concept. In particular, note that a GDD is defined with reference to both a base temperature and often a upper threshold temperature.

## Project specfication

This extend assignments can be thought of being made of a set of tasks to complete. The expectation is that your team this project will be completed by June 13, 2016.

### Minimum Core Tasks

All projects are expected to demonstrate the following components: 

1. Download daily historical temperature data for several citiesfrom 
  - http://climate.weather.gc.ca
This process should be automated. Additional information on bulk
downloads is available here:
  - ftp://client_climate@ftp.tor.ec.gc.ca/Pub/Get_More_Data_Plus_de_donnees/
  - You could either use wget as suggested or use the requests python library.

2. Create a plot showing an annual cycle of min/max daily temperatures.  Do this for at least three selected Canadian cities.

3. Write a command line program that takes arguments:
  - $ gdd *temperatures.csv* *tbase* *tupper* 
  - this program should calculate the GDD. Internally your program should handle the command line arguments (look up the package argparse) and implement the actual calculation as one or more functions. 
  - The output from this program needs to be persisently stored. Your choice on how to implement this storage.  Later steps in your work flow must use the results of these calculations.

4. Create plots showing accumulated GDD vs time for selected cities.

5. Use version control (git) and colloboration tools (GitHub) throughout this project.  Important: make sure you have properly set up your git configuration with your MUN email address. I will use this information to assess your individual contributations to this team project.
  - Team members should all colloborate on a single github repository. The use of branches is permitted but do not use github forks and pull requests.

6. Create a LaTeX report summarizing the results of your project.

7. Create a web based presenation for your results.
  - The remark-js library is nice for doing HTML based presenations
  - This is what I used for some of my lecture slides in this course
  - Host your presenation on a gh-pages branch of GitHub.

8. Implement your entire workflow as a Makefile. Ensure that your entire project is reproducible.

9. Create a testsuite (using the Python package nose) to demonstrate your GDD calculation works as intended (see chapter 18).

10. Your project should include adequate documentation both with your source code and an overall project Readme.md file to explain how to use/build your project.  See chapter 19 for some ideas on documentation. While the use of docstrings in your code is encouraged, you do *not* need to set up an automated documenation framework like Sphinx.

### Optional tasks

Do at least four of the following tasks:

1. Create an plot showing GDD like the example below for selected Canadian cities.
  - https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/onsite/features/2015/05/150507.png => Lutfur and Mehrzad

1. Create a map showing effective growing degrees over both all of Canada and only for the island of Newfoundland.
  -  http://www.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/img/env/climat/egdd_prairie_base_eng.jpg => Raji and Mehrzad

1. Explore how GDD calculation depends on the choice of T_base. show your results for either selected cities or create maps. => Yin

1. Create standalone bokeh plots embeded in your HTML presentation so that users can interactively select with the data (hover points) => Mohammad

1. Create a bokeh server plot so that you can look at the accumulated GDD for any city in Canada. => Mohammad

1. Compare GDD year over year.  Do some analysis (perhaps linear regression) to determine if GDDs have been changing in statistical significant way.  

1. Time/profile your work flow and estimate the amount of time spent in each step. Explore parallelization (either using python multiprocessing or make -j n) to make your work flow execute more quickly. 

### Final task

1. Free choice. Explore some aspect of the GDD dataset using analysis / visualization.  For example, could you make a map across showing the expected date for spring flowers to emerge?

## Evaluation

(DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT)

Assessment will based on both the actual results and demonstration of good scientific computating techniques as discussed within the course and the textbook.

- Minimum tasks 50%
- Optional tasks 20%
- Free choice task 5%
- Individual/team participation 10% (based on git contributions)
- Project/code review by peers 10% 
- Participation in code review 5%
